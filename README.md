# iOS-App-Development-Journey

I have been selected for iOS App Development Course offered in collaboration with **Apple** and **Infosys**. 9 month journey from scratch started from August 2023 and will be followed by internship at **Infosys** upon course completion.

**#DesignThinking**


**Problem Statement:** Early diagnosis of skin diseases avoiding delayed treatment.


**Motivation:** There is only 1 dermatologist per 250,000 people in world.
            About 23% people suffer from skin related diseases.


dermShield is a skin disease detection app that will diagnose skin related diseases which leave:
                distinct marks
                distinct colors
                distinct shape.

**Update: September 26:**
Prototype model is being built which being careful that only iOS elements will be used.
